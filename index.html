Preface

Welcome to my personal webpage.

I am a post-doctoral researcher working on human genomics.

In this page there is information about my research and my projects.


A brief summary

The main theme of my research is human genetics based on bioinformatic analysis, with focus mainly on population and medical genetics.

My research centers on:

    Genetics of complex diseases and population genetics.
    Genome-wide association studies, exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing and large scale data analysis.
    Analysis of common and rare genomic variants implicated in disease.
    Identification of population structure and stratification.

I did my PhD primarily at Democritus University of Thrace and at Purdue University, working in the Laboratory of Human Genome Variation under the supervision of Prof. Peristera Paschou.
