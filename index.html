<h2>Personal page of Fotis Tsetsos</h2>
<p>Welcome to my personal webpage.</p>
<p>I am a post-doctoral researcher working on human genomics.<br>
 In this page there is information about my research and my projects.</p>
<p>You can also check my <a href="pubs.html">publications</a>,<br>
 but also I sometimes upload some of my <a href="code.html">code and data.</a></p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
 
<h3>A brief summary</h3>
<p>The main theme of my research is human genetics based on bioinformatic analysis,<br>
 with focus mainly on population and medical genetics.</p>
<p>My research centers on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Genetics of complex diseases and population genetics.</li>
<li>Genomic and epigenomic large scale data analysis.</li>
<li>Analysis of common and rare genomic variants implicated in disease.</li>
<li>Identification of population structure and stratification.</li>
<li>Archaeogenetics</li>
</ul>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I studied Molecular Biology and Genetics at Democritus University of Thrace.</p>
<p>I did my PhD primarily at Democritus University and at Purdue University,<br>
 working in the Laboratory of Human Genome Variation under the supervision <br>
 of Prof. Peristera Paschou and Prof. Petros Drineas.</p>
